and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Basic logic gates implementation (AND, OR, NOT)
- Derived logic gates implementation (XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR)
- Interactive Tinkercad simulations for all gates
- Bilingual documentation logs (bitÃ¡coras 1.1.2 and 1.1.3)
- Comprehensive test suite for all gates
- Responsive iframe embedding via CSS

### Changed
- Moved XOR from basic gates to derived gates module
- Replaced static PNG circuit images with interactive Tinkercad simulations
- Reorganized bitÃ¡cora structure (1.1.2 for basic gates, 1.1.3 for derived gates)
- Updated iframe sizing from inline attributes to CSS-controlled responsive design
- Restructured navigation with separate sections for basic and derived gates

### Removed
- Static PNG images (AND.png, OR.png, NOT.png, XOR-OFF.png, XOR-ON.png)
- transistorBit.png reference image
- XOR implementation from logicGates.js module

### Technical Implementation
- `logicGates.js`: AND, OR, NOT functions
- `derivedGates.js`: XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR functions
- CSS aspect-ratio property for responsive iframe sizing (1.45:1)
- Modular test structure with visualizer.js for emoji output

### Planned
- 8-bit Register implementation
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Control Unit
- Memory system
- Complete CPU integration
