### XOR Circuit - Exclusive OR Gate
The XOR gate is implemented using a combination of basic gates: (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B). This gate is fundamental in binary arithmetic operations and parity detection.

</div>

**Resistance Calculations:**
- **Base resistances for transistors:**
  - R_base = (V_battery - V_BE) / I_B
  - R_base = (9V - 0.7V) / 0.01A = 830Œ© (use commercial value: 1kŒ©)
- **LED limiting resistor:**
  - R_LED = (V_battery - V_LED) / I_LED
  - R_LED = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Œ©

**Required Materials:**
- 2x Switches as inputs A and B
- 4x NPN Transistors (2N2222 or equivalent)
- 4x 1kŒ© Resistors (transistor bases)
- 1x 350Œ© Resistor (LED current limiter)
- 1x LED as output indicator
- 9V Battery
- Breadboard and connecting wires

**Transistor Configuration:**
1. **First pair (A AND NOT B):**
   - Emitter to Ground (GND)
   - Base through 1kŒ© resistor to switch A
   - Collector to next stage
2. **Second pair (NOT A AND B):**
   - Emitter to Ground (GND)
   - Base through 1kŒ© resistor to switch B
   - Collector to next stage
3. **Final OR stage:** Combines both results

**LED Configuration:**
- LED Anode > Battery VCC (9V)
- LED Cathode > 350Œ© Resistor > XOR Circuit Output

**Operation:**
- **Both switches OFF:** LED off (0 XOR 0 = 0)
- **One switch ON:** LED on (1 XOR 0 = 1 or 0 XOR 1 = 1)
- **Both switches ON:** LED off (1 XOR 1 = 0)
- **Why does it work?:** XOR returns 1 only when inputs are different. The circuit implements two AND blocks (A AND NOT B) and (NOT A AND B), then combines them with an OR. Only one block can activate at a time, producing the exclusive behavior.

### NAND Circuit - NOT AND Gate
The NAND gate is the inverse of AND. It's a universal gate, meaning any other logic gate can be built from NAND gates. This implementation uses an AND gate followed by an inverter.

**Resistance Calculations:**
- **Base resistances for transistors:**
  - In this gate, energy first passes through resistors and LEDs before reaching the transistors.
  - To calculate the base resistance, we calculate the LED limiting resistor:
- **LED limiting resistor:**
  - R_LED = (V_battery - V_LED) / I_LED
  - R_LED = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Œ©
  These resistors ensure that the LED operates within safe parameters, but also that the transistors function correctly.
- **Base resistance for transistor number 3:**
  - Following the principle that energy flows through the path of least resistance, we must calculate a higher resistance for the base of transistor 3, allowing energy to flow preferentially through the AND block before the inverter transistor. This is known as a pull-down resistor, whose standard values range from 1kŒ© to 10kŒ©.
  - R_base3 = (V_battery - V_BE) / I_B
  - R_base3 = (9V - 0.7V) / 0.0025A = 3320Œ© (use commercial value: 3.3kŒ©)

**Required Materials:**
- 2x Switches as inputs A and B
- 3x NPN Transistors (2 for AND + 1 for NOT)
- 1x 1kŒ© Resistor (transistor bases)
- 1x 3.3kŒ© Resistor (pull-down for transistor 3)
- 2x 350Œ© Resistors (LED current limiters)
- 1x LED as output indicator
- 9V Battery

**Transistor Configuration:**
1. **AND stage (2 transistors in series):**
   - First transistor: Emitter > GND, Base > LED 1 > 350Œ© Resistor > switch A
   - Second transistor: Emitter > Collector of first transistor, Base > LED 2 > 350Œ© Resistor > switch B, Collector > 3.3kŒ© pull-down resistor > Battery VCC (9V)
2. **NOT stage (1 inverter transistor):**
   - Third transistor: Collector > 1kŒ© Resistor > Battery VCC (9V), Base > 3.3kŒ© pull-down resistor > Battery VCC (9V), Emitter > LED 3 > Ground (GND)

**LED Configuration:**
- LED Anode > Battery VCC (9V)
- LED Cathode > 350Œ© Resistor > NAND Circuit Output

**Operation:**
- **Both switches OFF:** LED on (0 NAND 0 = 1)
- **One switch ON:** LED on (1 NAND 0 = 1 or 0 NAND 1 = 1)
- **Both switches ON:** LED off (1 NAND 1 = 0)
- **Why does it work?:** NAND is the inverse of AND. First, the series transistors perform the AND operation (they only conduct when both are active). This is achieved by using a pull-down resistor at the base of the inverter transistor, which allows energy to flow preferentially through the AND block before the inverter transistor. Then, the inverter transistor inverts this signal. When the AND produces 1 (both switches ON), the inverter activates and diverts the LED current to ground, turning it off. In any other case, the LED remains on.

### NOR Circuit - NOT OR Gate
The NOR gate is the inverse of OR, another universal gate. Any logic circuit can be built using only NOR gates. This implementation combines an OR gate with an inverter.

**Resistance Calculations:**
- **Base resistances for transistors:**
  - We calculate the LED limiting resistor:
- **LED limiting resistor:**
  - R_LED = (V_battery - V_LED) / I_LED
  - R_LED = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Œ©
- These resistors ensure that the LED operates within safe parameters, but also that the transistors function correctly.
- **Pull-down resistance for transistor 3:**
  - To calculate a pull-down resistor, you should use high resistances (1kŒ© to 10kŒ©) to ensure that energy flows preferentially through the OR block before the inverter transistor.
  - R_base3 = (V_battery - V_BE) / I_B
  - R_base3 = (9V - 0.6V) / 0.01A = 830Œ© (You can use the commercial value: 1kŒ©)


**Required Materials:**
- 2x Switches as inputs A and B
- 3x NPN Transistors (2 for OR + 1 for NOT)
- 1x 1kŒ© Resistor (pull-down for transistor 3)
- 2x 350Œ© Resistors
- 3x LEDs as output indicators
- 9V Battery

**Transistor Configuration:**
1. **OR stage (2 transistors in parallel):**
   - Both transistors (1 and 2) > Emitters to GND, Bases > Respective LEDs > 350Œ© Resistors > switches A and B respectively > Battery VCC (9V), Collectors > 1kŒ© pull-down resistor > Battery VCC (9V)
   - Third transistor: Emitter > LED Anode > GND, Base > 1kŒ© pull-down resistor, Collector > 1kŒ© pull-down resistor > Battery VCC (9V)

**LED Configuration:**
- LED Anode > Battery VCC (9V)
- LED Cathode > 350Œ© Resistor > NOR Circuit Output

**Operation:**
- **Both switches OFF:** LED on (0 NOR 0 = 1)
- **One switch ON:** LED off (1 NOR 0 = 0 or 0 NOR 1 = 0)
- **Both switches ON:** LED off (1 NOR 1 = 0)
- **Why does it work?:** NOR is the inverse of OR. The parallel transistors perform the OR operation (they conduct when either is active), preferring this because the pull-down resistor at the base of the inverter transistor allows energy to flow through the OR block before the inverter transistor. When the OR produces 1 (either switch ON), the inverter activates and diverts the LED current to ground, turning it off. Only when both switches are OFF does the LED remain on.

### XNOR Circuit - Exclusive NOR Gate
**Pending physical implementation**

**Note:** XNOR is useful as a comparator - the LED lights up when both inputs are equal.

### Experiment Analysis

#### 1. Truth Table Validation
‚úÖ **XOR:** Behavior verified - Only activates with different inputs  
‚úÖ **NAND:** Behavior verified - Activates except when both inputs are 1  
‚úÖ **NOR:** Behavior verified - Only activates when both inputs are 0  
‚öôÔ∏è **XNOR:** Pending physical implementation - Theoretical behavior: activates with equal inputs

#### 2. Hardware Considerations
- **LED Current:** Calculated according to the specific resistors in each circuit
- **Transistor Configuration:** NPN transistors used as digital switches
- **Base Resistors:** 1kŒ© resistors to limit base current and protect transistors
- **Power Supply:** 9V battery used for the main power supply
- **Complexity:** XOR and XNOR require more transistors than basic gates

#### 3. Hardware-Software Correspondence
- **Binary States:** Physical representation (LED ON/OFF) corresponds to software (1/0)
- **Boolean Logic:** Physical circuits implement the same operations as code
- **Scalability:** Principles applicable to more complex integrated circuits
- **Universality:** NAND and NOR can build any other logic gate

## Procedure 3: JavaScript Implementation

### Derived Gates Implementation

Derived gates are implemented using basic gates:

```javascript
// XOR using basic gates
function xor(a, b) {
    // XOR = (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B)
    return or(and(a, not(b)), and(not(a), b));
}

// NAND as inversion of AND
function nand(a, b) {
    return not(and(a, b));
}

// NOR as inversion of OR
function nor(a, b) {
    return not(or(a, b));
}

// XNOR as inversion of XOR
function xnor(a, b) {
    return not(xor(a, b));
    // Alternatively: (A AND B) OR (NOT A AND NOT B)
    // return or(and(a, b), and(not(a), not(b)));
}
```

### Practical Use Cases

#### XOR - Binary Addition
```javascript
// XOR is fundamental in binary addition (sum bit without carry)
function halfAdder(a, b) {
    const sum = xor(a, b);      // Sum bit
    const carry = and(a, b);     // Carry bit
    return { sum, carry };
}
```

#### XNOR - Equality Comparator
```javascript
// XNOR detects when two bits are equal
function bitsAreEqual(a, b) {
    return xnor(a, b);  // Returns 1 if a === b
}
```

#### NAND/NOR - Universal Construction
```javascript
// Example: NOT using only NAND
function notFromNand(a) {
    return nand(a, a);
}

// Example: AND using only NAND
function andFromNand(a, b) {
    return nand(nand(a, b), nand(a, b));
}
```
