## Procedure 1: Logic Gates Theoretical Foundations
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic boolean operations that are essential for data processing in digital systems. In this project, we will implement the three basic logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT. Based on Boolean mathematical logic, each gate has a specific function defined by its truth table.

### Implemented Gates

#### 1. AND Gate
- **Function:** Returns 1 only when both inputs are 1
- **Truth table:**
  ```
  A | B | A AND B
  0 | 0 |    0
  0 | 1 |    0
  1 | 0 |    0
  1 | 1 |    1
  ```

#### 2. OR Gate
- **Function:** Returns 1 when at least one input is 1
- **Truth table:**
  ```
  A | B | A OR B
  0 | 0 |   0
  0 | 1 |   1
  1 | 0 |   1
  1 | 1 |   1
  ```

#### 3. NOT Gate
- **Function:** Inverts the input value
- **Truth table:**
  ```
  A | NOT A
  0 |   1
  1 |   0
  ```

## Procedure 2: Tinkercad Simulation

### AND Circuit - AND Gate
The AND gate is implemented using NPN transistors in series configuration, where both transistors must be in the ON state for the LED to light up.

</div>

**Resistance calculations:**
- **Transistor base resistance:**
  - R_base = (V_battery - V_BE) / I_B
  - R_base = (9V - 0.7V) / 0.01A = 830Î© (use closest commercial value: 1kÎ©)

**Required Materials:**
- 2x Switches as inputs A and B
- 2x NPN Transistor (one for each input)
- 2x 1kÎ© Resistors (transistor bases)
- 1x 350Î© LED current limiting resistor
- 1x LED as output indicator
- Series connections to simulate AND operation

**Transistor configuration (NPN):**
- Transistor 1: Base > Resistor A 1kÎ© > Switch A
- Transistor 2: Base > Resistor B 1kÎ© > Switch B
- Transistor 1 emitter > Transistor 2 collector
- Transistor 2 emitter > Ground (GND)
- Transistor 1 collector > 350Î© resistor

**LED configuration:**
- LED anode > VCC Battery (9V)
- LED cathode > 350Î© resistor > Transistor 1 collector

**Control configuration:**
- Switch A > 1kÎ© resistor > Transistor 1 base
- Switch B > 1kÎ© resistor > Transistor 2 base

**Operation:**
- **Both switches OFF:** LED off (0 AND 0 = 0)
- **One switch ON:** LED off (1 AND 0 = 0 or 0 AND 1 = 0)
- **Both switches ON:** LED on (1 AND 1 = 1)
- **Why does it work?:** Only when both switches are on, since it is a series circuit. If transistor 1 does not allow energy to flow, it does not reach transistor 2, but if transistor 2 is off it also does not allow energy to flow to GND. Only when both transistors activate (ON) can current flow through them to ground (GND), turning on the LED.

### OR Circuit - OR Gate
The OR gate is implemented using NPN transistors in parallel configuration, where either transistor can be in the ON state for the LED to light up.

**Resistance calculations:**
- **Transistor base resistance:**
  - R_base = (V_battery - V_BE) / I_B
  - R_base = (9V - 0.7V) / 0.01A = 830Î© (use closest commercial value: 1kÎ©)

**Required Materials:**

- 2x 1kÎ© Resistors (transistor bases)
- 1x 350Î© LED current limiting resistor
- 1x LED as output indicator
- Parallel connections to simulate OR operation

**Transistor configuration (NPN):**
- Transistor 1: Base > Resistor A 1kÎ© > Switch A
- Transistor 2: Base > Resistor B 1kÎ© > Switch B
- Transistor 1 emitter > Ground (GND)
- Transistor 2 emitter > Ground (GND)
- Transistor 1 collector > 350Î© resistor
- Transistor 2 collector > 350Î© resistor (shared)

**LED configuration:**
- LED anode > VCC Battery (9V)
- LED cathode > 350Î© resistor > Transistor collectors (parallel connection)

**Control configuration:**
- Switch A > 1kÎ© resistor > Transistor 1 base
- Switch B > 1kÎ© resistor > Transistor 2 base

**Operation:**
- **Both switches OFF:** LED off (0 OR 0 = 0)
- **One switch ON:** LED on (1 OR 0 = 1 or 0 OR 1 = 1)
- **Both switches ON:** LED on (1 OR 1 = 1)
- **Why does it work?:** When both switches are off, both transistors are in the OFF state, preventing current from flowing through the LED, keeping it off. When either switch is on, the corresponding transistor activates (ON), allowing current to flow through it to GND, turning on the LED.

### NOT Circuit - NOT Gate
The NOT gate is implemented using an NPN transistor in inverter configuration, where the transistor functions as a switch that inverts the input signal.

**Resistance calculations:**
- **Transistor base resistance:**
  - R_base = (V_battery - V_BE) / I_B
  - R_base = (9V - 0.7V) / 0.01A = 830Î© (use closest commercial value: 1kÎ©)
- **LED pull-up resistance:**
  - R_pullup = (V_battery - V_LED) / I_LED
  - R_pullup = (9V - 2V) / 0.02A = 350Î©

**Required Materials:**
- 1x Switch as input A
- 1x NPN Transistor configured as inverter
- 1x 1kÎ© Resistor (transistor base)
- 1x 350Î© Resistor (LED pull-up)
- 1x LED as output indicator
- Inverter configuration: LED on when input is deactivated

**Transistor configuration (NPN):**
- Transistor: Base > 1kÎ© resistor > Switch A
- Transistor emitter > Ground (GND)
- Transistor collector > LED cathode

**LED configuration:**
- LED anode > 350Î© resistor > VCC Battery (9V)
- LED cathode > Transistor collector

**Control configuration:**
- Switch A > 1kÎ© resistor > Transistor base

**Operation:**
- **Switch OFF:** LED on (NOT 0 = 1) - Transistor OFF, current flows through LED
- **Switch ON:** LED off (NOT 1 = 0) - Transistor ON, current diverted to ground
- **Why does it work?:** Based on the fact that energy flows through the path of least resistance. When the switch is off, the transistor is in the OFF state, allowing current to flow through the LED, turning it on. When the switch is on, the transistor activates (ON), creating a direct path to ground (GND) and diverting current from the LED, turning it off.

## Procedure 3: Experiment Analysis

#### 1. Truth Table Validation
âœ… **AND:** Behavior verified - Only activates with both inputs at 1  
âœ… **OR:** Behavior verified - Activates with any input at 1  
âœ… **NOT:** Behavior verified - Correctly inverts the input  

#### 2. Hardware Considerations
- **LED Current:** Calculated according to the specific resistors in each circuit
- **Transistor Configuration:** NPN transistors used as digital switches
- **Base Resistors:** 1kÎ© resistors to limit base current and protect transistors
- **Power Supply:** 9V battery used for the main power supply

#### 3. Hardware-Software Correspondence
- **Binary States:** Physical representation (LED ON/OFF) corresponds to software (1/0)
- **Boolean Logic:** Physical circuits implement the same operations as code
- **Scalability:** Principles applicable to more complex integrated circuits

## Procedure 4: JavaScript Implementation

### Main File (logicGates.js)

The actual repository implementation uses the `bit` normalization function and exports the three basic gates in `logicGates/logicGates.js`.

```javascript
import { bit } from '../bit/bit.js';

export function AND(input1, input2) {
    const normalizedInput1 = bit(input1);
    const normalizedInput2 = bit(input2);
    return bit(normalizedInput1 && normalizedInput2);
}

export function OR(input1, input2) {
    const normalizedInput1 = bit(input1);
    const normalizedInput2 = bit(input2);
    return bit(normalizedInput1 || normalizedInput2);
}

export function NOT(input) {
    const normalizedInput = bit(input);
    return bit(!normalizedInput);
}

const logicGates = {
    AND,
    OR,
    NOT
};

export default logicGates;
```

### Test File (`test/logicGatesTest.js`)

The actual test file is located at `test/logicGatesTest.js` and uses the visualization helpers in `test/visualizeLogic/visualizer.js`. It imports `../logicGates/logicGates.js` and displays the results of each gate using emojis.

This matches the test file present in the workspace (`/test/logicGatesTest.js`).
